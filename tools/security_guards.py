"""Guards for this template's riskiest surfaces.

Run from anywhere: python3 tools/security_guards.py

This repo ships pre-approved Claude Code permissions and holds a user's personal
record. These guards make the dangerous changes LOUD, not impossible: a PR that
intentionally needs one of them must update the allowlists in this file in the
same diff, so the change is explicit and reviewable rather than buried.

Checks:
1. .claude/settings.json — every permissions.allow entry must be in the exact
   allowlist below. Catches permission widening (e.g. Bash(*), Bash(curl:*)),
   which would auto-approve commands on every fork. The same file's `hooks`
   key is held to an allowlist too: a hook runs automatically when its event
   fires, with no prompt, so it is strictly more dangerous than a pre-approved
   permission.
2. .gitignore — the personal-data ignore rules must all still be present,
   and no un-allowlisted negation (!pattern) may re-include them. Catches
   weakening that would make future users silently commit their tracker,
   documents, or application packets.
3. No package.json anywhere — this workspace runs on python3 and pdflatex, so
   there is no installer for a dependency's lifecycle script to run on a
   fork user's machine.

Stdlib only. Exit 0 on success, 1 with a failure list otherwise.
